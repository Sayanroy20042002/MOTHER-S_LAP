                <p>A study conducted by the Department of Child Development, Medical School of Izmir Odemis, Ege University, Turkey, aimed to investigate the creativity of children in pre-schools. A simple causal design with pre-and post-testswith a single group was used in the study.  The participantsconsisted of 184 children (96 boys, 88 girls) enrolled inpre-schools and nursery schools of the Ministry ofEducation, located in Ankara, during the 2014-2015academic year. Figural Creativity Form A and B ofTorrance Tests of Creative Thinking were used as pre- andpost-tests. The resultsshowed that pre-school curriculumincreased children’s creativity in a positive way. Further, they implemented that teachers should providechildren with materials to trigger their imagination, opportunities to imagine and explain their ideas,should appreciate children’s individuality and encourage their different viewpoints.</p>

                <p>As a part of mandatory 3 months rural posting during Internship, we were posted at Chiraigaon, Varanasi. The hospital was a rundown building in the middle of a vast expanse of agricultural land. There was poor sanitation, bad health care infrastructure, shabby dormitories for medicos, erratic electricity supply, pathetic roads, no tap water, lots of mosquitoes and frequent sighting of snakes. For obvious reasons, almost all interns would go back to college after few days of forced Rural Picnic! My first exposure to the reality of primary health care in India was quite disheartening. After having spent 5 years of my life in the grueling MBBS program, I found it difficult to overcome the feelings of regret, disillusionment and frustration. I had dreamt of a respectable career in a fancy hospital but now I was exposed to harsh realities that doctors have to face and those were not what I envisioned for myself. I started to think of changing my career by writing the Civil Service examination like some of my friends.</p>

                <p>Even the smallest of donations from you can help us provide care and support for a child. If you wish to sponsor a child’s education for a year, all you have to do is visit our official website and make an online donation in India for ₹28,200. Not only can such a donation bring about a drastic transformation in a child’s life, but you can also claim a tax exemption to the tune of 50% against said donation (under Section 80 G(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961).

                  It is no secret that a lack of education is a major cause of unemployment and a majority of social evils. Educating a child is the simplest way of empowering them and offering them an opportunity to find meaningful employment and, in turn, contribute to the growth of society and the economy. As an NGO in India, we understand the urgency of this task and we implore you to add one drop to the vast ocean of the cause of children’s education in the country.
                  
                  Head over to our official website now and make an online donation to support children’s education and care. It is a cause that deserves your attention and support!</p>

                <p>Development sector in India, in the recent years, has attracted youth like never before. From giving donations to collecting them, youngsters now find it better to invest their time in supporting and working for a cause than to sit at home during the summer break.

                  Considering this trend, we decided to explore the reasons that made it motivating for youth to be involved in social work. For this purpose, we interviewed Aastha Shreeharsh, student of The Shri Ram School, Aravalli and Anupriya Gaur, a 22 year old Business Development Associate.
                  
                  The conversation began with Aastha, who expressed her thoughts on whether the development sector should flourish in India or not. She said,
                  
                  “Lower segments of society believe that more the children, more the income. What they fail to understand is that children are entitled to basic rights like education, good health etc., thus failing to provide them with the same. For this reason, I believe, development sector in India should flourish. Even the corporate sector should emphasize more of their corporate social responsibility (CSR).”
                  
                  To this, Anupriya Gaur added,
                  
                  “The touchpoint should be a safe, healthy environment for children to grow into dynamic young citizens.”
                  
                  Both Aastha and Anupriya have worked/volunteered in the development sector before. On being asked about what motivates them to work for a social cause, Aastha shares,
                  
                  “Through the mandatory SUPW (Socially Useful and Productive Work) programmes organised in my school, I have been able to contribute in social work in the past. I love to paint and to be able to channelize my talent into something productive for a good cause is motivating.”
                  
                  Adding to this, Anupriya said,
                  
                  “I worked as an intern with SOS India during the summer of 2016. Post that, I also worked with Enactus India. The greatest motivation for me was to give back to society that I belong to, even if that is in a little measure. I wish to make a change in the lives of those who are too young to step out into the world and do it themselves.”</p>

                <p>Observed on June 12th every year, World Day Against Child Labour calls attention to the problem of child labour and the plight of children involved in the process worldwide. Child labour refers to depriving a child of his/her childhood by hampering their holistic development. At present, 541 workers between the ages of 15 to 24 constitute 15% of the total world’s labour force. Additionally, 152 million children between the ages of 5 to 17 around the world are engaged in child labour out of whom, 73 million are involved in work which is hazardous in nature.

                  (Source:http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/wdacl/lang–en/index.htm)
                  
                  Launched by The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2002, the day primarily focuses on the global extent of the issue and the actions required to address the problem, eventually eliminating it fully. In 2018, the focal point stands on a joint global campaign including World Day for Safety and Health (Safe Day) and World Day Against Child Labour (WDACL) emphasizing on the need to improve safety and health of young workers and to end child labour, respectively.

                <p>Children are as responsive to love and care as plants are to water and sunlight. Raising a child is similar to nurturing a little sapping. A child like a fledging sapling must be sown in a fertile bed, assured of the security and love provided by a family. Nourishment provide by the SOS mother and a loving environment helps the child, much like the seedling, bloom into an intelligent and ideal citizen. At SOS India, we believe that all children are like plants, each unique in their beauty and strength. Our aim is to help them realize their full potential.

                  From the beginning, SOS India, one of the best NGO in India has been involved in providing children in need of care and protection a home-like environment to grow up among brothers and sisters, nurtured by a mother, through its Family Like Care (FLC) Programme. The organization also bought everything the children needed. These were toys, teaching materials and clothes. SOS India also reaches out to children at risk of falling out of the safety net of familial care and protection through Family Strengthening Programme (FSP). FSP uses a two-pronged approach, empowering the caregivers, especially women, through enhancement of their income and simultaneously, providing health and educational support to their children.</p>

              <p style="font-size: x-small;">MOTHERS LAP was initiated in 2002 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to the society. They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning who has propagated that “sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems…” and corporate leaders can’t expect governments to solve them alone.

                What triggered these thoughts was the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1990’s which brought with it immense opportunities. Business revived, and India became not just a market, but also an investment prospect for the developed world. Disposable incomes and early settlements became a living reality for the working middle-class. For the first time in India, professionals could think beyond making a living, and contribute towards the society.</p>
